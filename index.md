# Technical Product Management Audit Report

**Date:** December 15, 2025

**Scope:** Small brief summary of frontend structure, user experience and blockchain protocols

*How well does the current frontend reflect a clear product vision and deliver a seamless user experience for a decentralized trading platform?
Based on checking the UI in this project, what improvements would you suggest to make the Markets and History page of the front-end more efficient or user-friendly?*

*Which blockchain protocols, smart contract structures, or token mechanisms would you consider, and why?*

## 1. Product Vision & User Experience (Frontend)

Based on the file structure, the **frontend** reflects a modern and robust product **vision**

### Strengths
* **Modern Architecture:** The use of **React** (`.tsx`), **Vite**, and **TypeScript** indicates a solid, maintainable, and scalable foundation.
* **Clear UI Components:** `src/components/ui` (`chart.tsx`, `table.tsx`, `card.tsx`) suggests a modular interface focused on data visualization, nice
* **Logical Flow:** The routes (`dashboard`, `markets`, `trading`, `wallet`) cover the standard UX for a trading platform

### ⚠️ Ambiguities & Areas for Improvement
* **"Decentralization" ** There is friction between the backend (`server/`) and the contracts (`contracts/`).
    * `TradingController.js` points to off-chain logic.
    * It appears to be a model where the order book is centralized
    * *UX Impact:* The use of traditional `Login.tsx` vs. `Connect Wallet` may erode Web3 users trust
    * The presence of a traditional JWT-based authentication system, with /login and /register endpoints (server/routes/auth.js), confirms that the user model deviates from the 'Connect Wallet' (dApp experience), creating friction with the decentralization narrative

## 2. UI Improvements 

### `Markets.tsx`

**Usability Improvements:**
* **Favorites:** Implement `toggle.tsx` to bookmark pairs.
* **Sparklines:** Use `chart.tsx` to display mini trend charts (24h) within the table.
* **Quick Actions:** "Trade" buttons on mouse hover

### `History.tsx`
*Currently: Transaction table.*

**Efficiency Improvements:**
1.  **Advanced Filters:** Filter by type (Trade, Stake, Deposit) using `select.tsx`.

**Usability Improvements:**
* **Humanization:** Translate tx IDs into readable text (*"Buy/sell 0.5 ETH"*).
* **Deep Linking:** Direct links to tx links.

## 3. Protocols & Smart Contracts

### ⛓️ Blockchain Protocols
Given the use of Solidity (`.sol`), I recommend the following EVM networks:

* **Avalanche C-chain**. It  offers high volume and EVM security with low costs and high speed.

AND

* **Ethereum Mainnet:** Due to the recent Fusaka upgrade, transaction costs are lower, making mainnet an excellent environment to showcase and validate a system like this.

### 🏗️ Contract Structure
* **`LumenToken.sol`:** Should implement **EIP-2612** for gasless approvals
* **`Governance.sol`:** OpenZeppelin *Governor* style for voting on protocol changes.

### 🪙 Tokenomics (LumenToken)
* **Utility:** Governance and trading fee discounts
* **Deflation:** Implement a **Buy-Back & Burn** mechanism using a % of exchange fees.
